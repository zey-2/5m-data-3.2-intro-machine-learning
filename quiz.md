- A. Regression
- B. Clustering
- C. Classification
- D. Dimensionality Reduction

### Q7: What is the purpose of splitting a dataset into training and testing sets?

- A. To increase the amount of data available for training
- B. To avoid overfitting and evaluate the model on unseen data

- C. Model deployment
- D. Hyperparameter optimization

### Q9: In linear regression, what does a high Sum of Squares of Residuals (SSR) relative to the Total Sum of Squares (SST) indicate?

- A. The model explains a large proportion of the variance in the dependent variable.
- B. The model fits the data very well.
- C. The model does not explain the variance in the dependent variable well.
- D. The model is overfit.

### Q10: What is the Sigmoid function used for in Logistic Regression?

- A. To calculate the distance between data points
- B. To convert any input to a value between 0 and 1, representing a probability
- C. To measure the error of the model
- D. To add a constant term to the predictor
